💾 Data Privacy

> Zero tracking. Zero ads. Zero BS.
Everything lives locally in your browser — you own your data, not some random server farm.

---

🧠 How It Works (Simplified)

1. Activation: User presses the configured activation key.

2. Hover Detection: Content script detects hovered links and sends them to the background script.

3. Storage: Links are stored in browser local storage via a unified browserAPI wrapper.

4. Popup Display: Popup UI fetches and shows grabbed links with filters and actions.

5. Session Finalization: On command, session data can be finalized.

🧰 browserAPI Wrapper

A compatibility layer that abstracts differences between browser APIs.
This ensures smooth behavior across Chromium-based and Firefox browsers.

Example:

import { browserAPI } from "./utils/browser-api";

await browserAPI.storage.set("links", grabbedLinks);
const links = await browserAPI.storage.get("links");
